Operator-Based Static Complete Rebalancing Problem with Heterogeneous Fleet and Battery Replacement in Bicycle Sharing Systems
Each instance includes: 
the number of nodes (N), 
the number of rebalancing vehicle types (K), 
the distance matrix (c), 
the e-bike surplus/shortage quantities for the nodes/stations (d), 
the battery replacement time spent at any station (tt), 
the number of rebalancing vehicles of type k (V), 
the e-bike carrying capacity of type k rebalancing vehicle (Q), 
the speed of type k rebalancing vehicle (alfa) (unit is time/distance), 
the battery carrying capacity of type k rebalancing vehicle (C), 
the number of battery replacements for e-bikes at the nodes/stations (b), 
the unit distance cost of type k rebalancing vehicle (beta) (unit is cost/distance), 
the fixed cost of using type k rebalancing vehicle (f).
The number at the end of the file name indicates the number of rebalancing vehicle types in the problem. Namely, Real1_7_7_5_2V.dat has 2 different types of rebalancing vehicles.
